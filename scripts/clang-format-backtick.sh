# Format with the prototype's clang-format rather than a stock one.
#
# The infix backtick was implemented in clang/lib/Format alongside the parser,
# so the compiler prefix ships a clang-format that knows the canonical style:
# spaces outside the pair, hug inside -- a `f` b. A stock clang-format has not
# been observed to mangle these files, but it has no rule for the operator, so
# it is only a matter of time.
#
# Override with CLANG_FORMAT=/path/to/clang-format.
